## Professional and Research Experiences

* **October 2024 -- April 2025**: Senior Researcher with ELIXIR Norway and at *Universitetet i Bergen*, Norway.
I contributed to ontologies for bioimaging data (EDAM bioimaging), metadata standards, pipelines and interoperability of open repositories for scientific biological images.

* **October 2019 -- September 2023**: As Postdoctoral Fellow at *Universitetet i Bergen*, Norway, I developed reliable methods of causal inference based on instrumental variables and path analysis for omics data. These methods can infer regulatory networks from population data. 
Part of the group of Tom Michoel at the Computational Biology Unit, Dept. of Informatics

* **2021 -- 2023**: Lecturer and course responsible for [INF115: Databases and Modeling](https://www.uib.no/en/course/INF115) at the Deptartment of Informatics, the University of Bergen, Norway.
The course covers the Relational Model, Entity Relationship Diagrams, SQL, Indices, Transactions and storage methods. It includes an introduction to cloud technologies for databases and NoSQL solutions.

* **2016 -- 2019**: As Postdoctoral Researcher at *Universitat de Barcelona*, Spain,
I have worked within the MesoBrain project on methods to infer the causal connectivity of neurons from calcium fluorescence imaging using Transfer Entropy as well as simulations of neuronal networks on spatial patterns.
Part of the NeuroPhysics group of Jordi Soriano, Dept. of Condensed Matter Physics

* **2012 -- 2015**: PhD in physics at the *Université Pierre et Marie Curie* in Paris. My [thesis](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01597902) presents the structure and phase transitions between amorphous and crystalline solutions of NaCl in water. I performed experiments on ices at high pressure using diffraction methods, classical and ab-initio molecular simulations, and random structure searching calculations. I produced the samples experimentally, designed models and carried out simulations, and analysed the data.
Part of the group of Stefan Klotz, CNRS, IMPMC

* **Spring 2012**: Project on Stochastic Dynamics of a quorum sensing Network at *Lund University*. I performed simulations of the stochastic kinetics (using the Gillespie algorithm) of a bistable chemical network controlling the collective behaviour of bacteria.
Advisor: Henrik Jönsson, Computational Biology and Biological Physics group

* **Spring 2011**:
  Master’s [thesis](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/lup/publication/2158517) in Astrophysics at *Lund University*, Sweden
Proof of detectability by the Gaia mission of a quadrupolar lensing effect in the solar neighbourhood
predicted by general relativity for observations close to flattened massive bodies such as Jupiter.
Advisors: David Hobbs and Lennart Lindegren, Lund Observatory



## Education


* **2011 -- 2012**: Master of Science in Physics at *Lund University*, Sweden

* **2008 -- 2011**: Diplôme d’Ingénieur Supaéro: Master’s degree in Aeronautics and Space Engineering of the *Institut Supérieur de l’Aéronautique et de l’Espace*, Toulouse, France

* **2008 -- 2010**: Bachelor in Mathematics at *Université Paul Sabatier* in Toulouse, France

* **2006 -- 2008**: Undergraduate major in Mathematics and Physics at *Lycée Henri IV* in Paris, France: preparation for entrance exams to French graduate schools (“Grandes Ecoles”)
