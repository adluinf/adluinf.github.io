## Professional and Research Experiences

* **October 2019 -- present**: As Postdoctoral Fellow at *Universitetet i Bergen*, Norway, I am developing reliable methods of causal inference and path analysis for omics data. These methods infer regulatory networks from omics data. 
Part of the group of Tom Michoel at the Computational Biology Unit, Dept. of Informatics

* **Spring 2021**: Lecturer and course responsible for INF115: Databases and Modeling

* **2016--2019**: As Postdoctoral Researcher at *Universitat de Barcelona*,
    Spain, I have worked within MesoBrain project on methods to infer the connectivity of neurons from calcium fluorescence imaging using Transfer Entropya as well as simulations of neuronal networks on spatial patterns.
Part of the NeuroPhysics group of Jordi Soriano, Dept. of Condensed Matter Physics

* **2012--2015**: PhD in physics at the *Université Pierre et Marie Curie* in Paris. My [thesis](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01597902) is about amorphous and crystalline solutions of NaCl in water studied using diffraction, classical and ab-initio molecular simulations, random structure searching.
Part of the group of Stefan Klotz, CNRS, IMPMC

* **Spring 2012**: Project on Stochastic Dynamics of a quorum sensing Network at *Lund University*. Simulations of stochastic kinetics of a bistable chemical network controlling the collective behaviour of bacteria.
Advisor: Henrik Jönsson, Computational Biology and Biological Physics group

* **Spring 2011**:
  Master’s [thesis](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/lup/publication/2158517) in Astrophysics at *Lund University*, Sweden
Proof of detectability by the Gaia mission of a quadrupolar lensing effect in the solar neighbourhood
predicted by general relativity for observations close to flattened massive bodies such as Jupiter.
Advisors: David Hobbs and Lennart Lindegren, Lund Observatory



## Education


* **2011--2012**: Master of Science in Physics at *Lund University*, Sweden

* **2008--2011**: Diplôme d’Ingénieur Supaéro: Master’s degree in Aeronautics and Space Engineering of the *Institut Supérieur de l’Aéronautique et de l’Espace*, Toulouse, France

* **2008--2010**: Bachelor in Mathematics at *Université Paul Sabatier* in Toulouse

* **2006--2008**: Undergraduate major in Mathematics and Physics at *Lycée Henri IV* in Paris, preparation for entrance exams to French graduate schools (“Grandes Ecoles”)
