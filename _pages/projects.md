My research interests and past experience cover diverse areas of biological and physical phenomena, ranging from **network inference** for genomics and neuroscience, **modeling regulatory networks** in the context medical applications, *quorum sensing* in bacteria, simulations of *neuronal activity*, to phase transitions, crystallisation and gravitational deflection of light.

# Current Projects

- **Causal Inference and Omics**: 
My current research with [Tom Michoel](https://lab.michoel.info/) in the Computational Biology Unit focuses on ***causal inference*** methods and their applications on **genomic** and **multi-omic** data. I am developing methods to distinguish correlation from causation given genomic population data. My goal is to participate in improving our understanding of complex **gene regulatory networks** (GRN) involving thousands of genes and their products in order to establish their **phenotypic trait** outcomes. This work has implications on the study of diseases and healthy phenotypes and finding therapeutic targets. See for example the [github repository](https://github.com/michoel-lab/FindrCausalNetworkInferenceOnYeast) and reference [[1]](/publications/).

- **Simulating Regulatory Networks**:
I am currently working with models of gene regulatory networks. I have also worked with integrate and fire models of neuronal dynamics and the processes generating connections between neurons [[2]](/publications/). Before that, I have studied models and simulated the stochastic kinetics of a bistable chemical network controlling the collective behaviour (quorum sensing) of bacteria.

# Past Projects

- **Inference of Neuronal Connectivity**: In my previous research with [Jordi Soriano](https://www.soriano-lab.eu/) at the University of Barcelona, Spain, I have worked with inference methods based on **information theory** to study functional connectivity of *living* **neuronal networks**. I used **transfer entropy** (TE) to infer the connections formed between individual neurons in 2D and 3D in vitro cultures. I worked in closely with colleagues at the Institute of Photonic Sciences (ICFO) near Barcelona on the calcium fluorescence imaging of the samples using light sheet imaging for 3D samples. Our goal being to contribute to a better understanding of the computational capabilities of nervous systems, I have also worked with integrate and fire models of neuronal dynamics and the processes generating connections between neurons. See reference [[2]](/publications/).
