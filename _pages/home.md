**Welcome to my personal website!**

I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Computational Biology Unit (CBU), Department of Informatics of the  University of Bergen.

# Research Interests

My research interests cover diverse areas of biological and physical phenomena: **network inference** -- genomics -- neuroscience -- **mathematical modeling** -- **regulatory networks** -- *quorum sensing* -- *neuronal activity* -- phase transitions -- gravitational effects.

- **Causal Inference and Omics**: 
My current research with [Tom Michoel](https://lab.michoel.info/) in the CBU focuses on ***causal inference*** methods and their applications on **genomic** and **multi-omic** data. This work has implications on the study of diseases and healthy phenotypes and finding therapeutic targets. See [1] and my [Projects](/projects/)

- **Inference of Neuronal Connectivity**: I have used inference methods based on **information theory** to study functional connectivity of *living* **neuronal networks**. My aim is to understand and model the computational capabilities of nervous systems. See [2] and my [Projects](/projects/)
