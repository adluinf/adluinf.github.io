**Welcome to my personal website!**

I develop algorithms and computational methods based on machine learning and statistical inference to generate quantitative insight from real data. I am open to new opportunities, please do get in touch!

# Research Interests

My research interests cover diverse areas of biological and physical phenomena: **causal inference** -- **mathematical modeling** -- **genomics** -- **neuroscience** -- **regulatory networks** -- *quorum sensing* -- *neuronal activity* -- **phase transitions** -- *geometrical patterns* -- gravitational effects.

- **Inference**: 

- **Inference of Neuronal Connectivity**: I have used inference methods based on **information theory** to study the functional connectivity of ***living*** **neuronal networks**. These models can contribute to better understand the computational capabilities of nervous systems. See [2] and my [Projects](/projects/).

- **Causal Inference and Omics**: 
My research with [Tom Michoel](https://lab.michoel.info/) has focused on ***causal inference*** methods and their applications on **genomic** and **multi-omic** data. This work has implications on the study of diseases and healthy phenotypes and finding therapeutic targets. See [1] and my [Projects](/projects/).

- **Modeling**: 

- **Simulating Regulatory Networks**:
I have worked on models of gene regulatory networks, and I have studied integrate and fire models of *neuronal dynamics* and the processes generating connections between neurons [[2]](/publications/), and the stochastic kinetics of a chemical network controlling *quorum sensing* in bacteria.

- **Simulating Networks of living neurons**:
I am currently working with models of gene regulatory networks. Previously, I have studied integrate and fire models of *neuronal dynamics* and the processes generating connections between neurons [[2]](/publications/), and the stochastic kinetics of a chemical network controlling *quorum sensing* in bacteria.
